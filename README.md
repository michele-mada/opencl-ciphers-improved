# opencl-ciphers-improved

Project based on [https://github.com/Angtrim/opencl-ciphers](https://github.com/Angtrim/opencl-ciphers),
with substantial structural modification, in order to make it more efficient and modular.

This project is just an intermediate step towards the goal of developing a full-fledged
OpenSSL engine.

The final version will be especially optimized for a FPGA device.
